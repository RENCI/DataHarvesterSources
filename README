# Observational data (NOAA and CONTRAILS) 

The stoptime for observational data (NOAA/Contrails) is used in conjunction with the --ndays (look back) to specify the time range
(inclusive) to fetch data. For Contrails, this time range must be broken up into < 24 hour groups and not span multiple days. So what can happen (?)
Suppose you execute the job: python fetch_data.py --data_source 'CONTRAILS' --data_product 'river_water_level' --stoptime '2022-01-16 00:00:00'
This will result in a set of time_periods (time_start,time_end) as follows: 

INFO:dataharvester_services:Iterate: start time is 2022-01-14 00:00:00, end time is 2022-01-14 23:59:59, station is 30033
INFO:dataharvester_services:Contrails. Converting to meters
INFO:dataharvester_services:Iterate: start time is 2022-01-15 00:00:00, end time is 2022-01-15 23:59:59, station is 30033
INFO:dataharvester_services:Contrails. Converting to meters
INFO:dataharvester_services:Iterate: start time is 2022-01-16 00:00:00, end time is 2022-01-16 00:00:00, station is 30033
 
The last period only has a single time in it (2022-01-16 00:00:00). This is not intrinsically a problem, BUT, Contrails rarely captures
data on the 00Z time. As a result this last time period will return nothing and the FINAL data product time series will end as follows:

(snip)
2022-01-15T22:45:00,30033,0.3383280000000001
2022-01-15T23:00:00,30033,0.3383280000000001
2022-01-15T23:15:00,30033,0.3383280000000001
2022-01-15T23:30:00,30033,0.3383280000000001

So this _may_ seem inconsistent with the user supplied stoptime value but it is not.

The NOAA data is simply passed the user specified time range and this has not been seen to happen for NOAA.

# Output Observations filenames

The water_level data nomenclature will be:

{source}_stationdata_{group}_{stoptime}.csv

where {group} only applies to contrails. Examples include:
    contrails_stationdata_RIVERS_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv
    contrails_stationdata_COASTAL_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv
    noaa_stationdata_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv

The water_level metadata files follow a similar nomenclature

{source}_stationdata_meta_{group}_{stoptime}.csv

where {group} only applies to contrails. Examples include:
    contrails_stationdata_meta_RIVERS_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv
    contrails_stationdata_meta_COASTAL_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv
    noaa_stationdata_meta_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv

# ASGS data (ADCIRC)

# Output ASGS/ADCIRC filenames

The resulting output filenames include additional filename metadata to account for the possibility that 
for a given TIME, one could have nowcasts and forecasts.

adcirc_stationdata_{instance}_{gridname}_{starttime}.csv

adcirc_stationdata_meta_nowcast_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv
adcirc_stationdata_nowcast_2022-01-16T00:00:00.csv

###### Invocation

Though, all desired source providers are abstracted inside the class fetch_station_data
access to that data is via the harvesters fetch_data.py and fetch_adcirc_data.py.
Observation and ASGS data are generally treated somewhat differently

# Observational data (NOAA and CONTRAILS) 

Invoking the observation code is straight forward and uses the harvester: fetch_data.py. The CLI follows:
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ndays NDAYS         Number of look-back days from stoptime (or now):
                        default -2
  --stoptime STOPTIME   Desired stoptime YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS. Default=now
  --sources             List currently supported data sources
  --data_source DATA_SOURCE
                        choose supported data source (case independant) eg
                        NOAA or CONTRAILS
  --data_product DATA_PRODUCT
                        choose supported data product eg river_water_level:
                        Only required for Contrails

Data are extracted from the stoptime (or now) with a lookback of ndays. Data are inclusive. The only data_sources
supported are NOAA and CONTRAILS. The supported data products can vary:

NOAA: water_level
CONTRAILS: river_water_level and coastal_water_level

Examples follow: The first block imply a stoptime of now(). The second specify it as '2022-01-16 00:00:00'

python fetch_data.py --data_source 'CONTRAILS' --data_product 'coastal_water_level'
python fetch_data.py --data_source 'CONTRAILS' --data_product 'river_water_level'
python fetch_data.py --data_source 'NOAA' --data_product 'water_level'

python fetch_data.py --data_source 'CONTRAILS' --data_product 'coastal_water_level' --stoptime '2022-01-16 00:00:00'
python fetch_data.py --data_source 'CONTRAILS' --data_product 'river_water_level' --stoptime '2022-01-16 00:00:00'
python fetch_data.py --data_source 'NOAA' --data_product 'water_level' --stoptime '2022-01-16 00:00:00'

Note: ndays could be specified as a positive number (+2_. In effect taking the input stoptime and treating it as a start and looking forward 
this is not used by us and testing has not been performed. Mostly likely, this will simply result in filenames that can be misleading.

# ASGS data (ADCIRC)

The input URL MUST have the following structure:

http://tds.renci.org:8080/thredds/dodsC/2022/nam/2022011600/hsofs/hatteras.renci.org/hsofs-nam-bob-2021/nowcast/fort.61.nc
url.split('/') gives rise to
where [-6] must include the TIME (%Y%m%d%H)
      [-5] must be the GRIDNAME (case independent. hsofs, ec95d, etc.)
      [-2] must be the INSTANCE name (eg nowcasty, forecast, veerrright, etc)

TIME will be used in subsequent output filenameing regardsless of itr being nowcast or forecast.
Check the associated metadata['NAME'] file for this status ( or compare to the provided timeseries) 

Grabbing ADCIRC data from ASGS is a little different. In this case, a fully specified URL must be passed. No user 
specified stoptime is available as the times returned are those found in the returned URL data set. The return time series
can vary depending on the ASGS status of prior runs. Examples of three invocations follows:

The ASGS data are acquired using the code: fetch_adcirc_data.py. The CLI arguments are:

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --sources             List currently supported data sources
  --data_source DATA_SOURCE
                        choose supported data source: default = ASGS
  --url URL             ASGS url to fetcb ADCIRC data
  --data_product DATA_PRODUCT
                        choose supported data product: default is water_level

The supported data_product is 'water_level' (and is the default)
The suported data_source is ASGS.

Currently, if you pass in a hurricane url, the job will exit.

Examples follow:

python fetch_adcirc_data.py --url http://tds.renci.org:8080/thredds/dodsC/2022/nam/2022011600/hsofs/hatteras.renci.org/hsofs-nam-bob-2021/nowcast/fort.61.nc --data_source 'ASGS'
python fetch_adcirc_data.py --url http://tds.renci.org:8080/thredds/dodsC/2022/nam/2022011600/hsofs/hatteras.renci.org/hsofs-nam-bob-2021/namforecast/fort.61.nc --data_source 'ASGS'

# An example of a Hurricane to demonstrate  trapping and exit
python fetch_adcirc_data.py --url http://tds.renci.org:8080/thredds/dodsC/2021/ida/11/hsofs/hatteras.renci.org/hsofs-al09-bob/nhc0fcl/fort.61.nc --data_source 'ASGS'
